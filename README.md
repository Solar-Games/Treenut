# Treenut
 Treenut - A scripting language.

## Goals
 Our goal is to simply make a scripting language that is based on C.
 
## Current Issues
 You cannot re-run a output file from the compiler with all the tokens.
 ~(| / !) (number)+ (string) raises an syntax error.
 (defined variable) = (value) raises a definition error.
 
## Intentional Design
 This: ~| (Print) / ~! (Error).
